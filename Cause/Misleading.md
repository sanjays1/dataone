>  *There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics* ~ Mark Twain

Mark Twain might have been a tad too harsh with his evaluation of one of the core tenets of data science, but there is a certain level of truth to what he said. Statistics can become extremely misleading, especialy when used to bolster weak arguments. 

In this lesson we'll talk about some common ways that statistics can be used to mislead (usually unintentionally but sometimes even intentionally! )  

### Accuracy vs. Precision

Let's pretend we were reading two reports, both containing statistics on the African Cheetah, nature's fastest land animal. Report #1 described the weight of an average cheetah as being "above" 100 lbs while report #2 described the average weight be approximately 152.4 lbs. Which report should we trust? 

We might lean towards report #2 but doing so would be committing a common fallacy when analyzing numbers, mistaking **accuracy** with **precision**. 

The truth is that there is quite a bit of variability on the weight of adult cheetahs. (They can range from weighing 83 lbs all the way to 145 lbs). Claiming that the average cheetah weighs 152.4 pounds would be very **precise** but wouldn't be very **accurate** since it's completely out of the observed weight range. In this case, Report #1 is actually more accurate because most cheetas are in fact above 100 lbs. 

We obviously want statistics that are both accurate and precise, but it's a common mistake to automatically assume accuracy out of precise measurements. 

### Units of Measurement 

Politician A | Our economy is doing terrible, thity states have lost jobs in the past year! 

Politician B | Our economy is doing fantastic, we've had postiive job growth in the U.S.! 

Who's correct here? Well technically both are.  

Looking at the state level, it can be correct to make the argument that the economy is doing poorly based on the lack of job growth at the state level. The **unit used to measure** job growth is individual state economies. 

Meanwhile it can also be accurate to argue that the economy is doing well if the unit of measurement we use is at the national level. States with larger populations such as New York may be having stronger job growth while other less populated states, such as North Dakota and Montana, may be loosing employment.
